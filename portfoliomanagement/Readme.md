## PORTFolio Management

### Pre-requisite to run application: 
1)	Maven V 3.2 or higher
2)	Java V 1.8 or higher

### Steps to run the application: 
1)	GOTO: {rootDirectory} of the application in command line.
2)	In a command line: mvn spring-boot:run

Since this is a spring boot application you donâ€™t have to deploy war in external tomcat. It should run the application in embedded tomcat. After the app is up it will run in port 8090.
When the application boots. Two default advisors are created for you in h2 database (in-memory database). 

Name	    Username	Password
advisor1	advisor1	pass1
advisor2	advisor2	pass2 

Two models are created for advisor1 and one model is created for advisor2. 

### Get Models for advisor:
**/v1/advisor/{advisorId}/model**
This call will return all the model of the advisor if the advisor is authenticated and has access to the models.

Example Calls:
In chrome:  http://localhost:8090/v1/advisor/1/model  fill username: advisor1 and password: pass1. 

Post man:  In postman  
1.	use  http://localhost:8090/v1/advisor/1/model as URL. 
2.	Set Method as GET
3.	Set Authorization Type: Basic Auth
4.	Set username: advisor1 and  password: pass1

CURL: Run following CURL command:
```
  curl -X GET \
  http://localhost:8090/v1/advisor/1/model \
  -H 'authorization: Basic advisor1:pass1' \
  
 ```
